# Campus

## Welcome to Race01
>This is the first project of [Innovation Campus](https://www.kpi.kharkov.ua/rus/2021/01/21/innovation-campus-ntu-hpi-pervyj-etap/). It is a special course in our University.
> Project was created by @Sheeseburger and @annabellehere
## Explaining the project 
>In this race we need to create simple 3d models in terminal window:

| Cube | Pyramid |

### Math details:
#### Cube:
- number of **"|"**  in one vertical line equals to **n**
- number of **"-"**  in one horizontal line equals to **(2 * n)**
- number of **"/"**  in one diagonal line equals to **(n / 2)**
- **(n > 1)**

#### Pyramid: 
- the number of **"/ "** in line that relates to the front triangle, equals to **n**
- the number of **"\"**  in line that relates to the front and side triangles, equals to **(n - 1)**
- the number of **"\"**  in line that relates only to the side triangle, equals to **(n / 2)**
- he number of **"|"**  in vertical line equals to **(n / 2)**
- he number of_  in horizontal line equals to **(2 * n - 3)**
- **(n > 1)** n is **even**

## Task managment
> We decided to work 50/50.I took pyramid and Anna cube.

### Progress: 
> Both of us had similar logic.We started program from 2d objects and upgrading it step-by-step. Anna took more mathematical approach. She made a bunch of If else for choosing symbol for printing. While I divided pyramid to three parts(left,middle and right side). After completing our main tasks we met each other and started conversation on how to improve our code and approuches.


### Afterwords: 
> It was our second time when we working as one team,but this time Anna was our Teamleader.This race mainly about understanding team system,because we both agree that our tasks wasn`t as difficult as we expected.
