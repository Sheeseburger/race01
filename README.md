### Math details:
> Operands is more or equal to 0.
> We have to work with + - * / 

## Task managment
> We decided to work 50/50.I took pyramid and Anna cube.

### Progress: 
> Both of us had similar logic.We started program from 2d objects and upgrading it step-by-step. Anna took more mathematical approach. She made a bunch of If else for choosing symbol for printing. While I divided pyramid to three parts(left,middle and right side). After completing our main tasks we met each other and started conversation on how to improve our code and approuches.


### Afterwords: 
> It was our second time when we working as one team,but this time Anna was our Teamleader.This race mainly about understanding team system,because we both agree that our tasks wasn`t as difficult as we expected.
